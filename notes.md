# Notes

## Inspiration

- can always just use my existing portfolio...
- [color scheme is nice](https://www.behance.net/gallery/146736515/Portfolio-Graphic-Designer?tracking_source=search_projects%7Cportfolio)
- [like the font and simplicity](https://christy-hu.com/index.html)
- [love the cards on this one tho](https://dyotanya.com/en)
- [always have liked this one](https://karinasirqueira.com/)
- [i like the bubbles that pop up on the left and right](https://olhauzhykova.com/)

probably gonna just take the color and fonts off #1-2 and put them into the last one  
I like the idea of having patterns in the background - not sure how I should be placing them tho

fonts: Satoshi (sans-serif), AustinItalic
